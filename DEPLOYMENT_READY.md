# Deployment Ready! 🚀

Your workspace is now ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment.

## Issues Fixed:

### SQLite3 Compatibility Issue ✅
- **Problem**: ChromaDB requires SQLite3 ≥ 3.35.0, but Streamlit Cloud uses older version
- **Solution**: Migrated from ChromaDB to FAISS vector database
- **Migration**: Successfully converted 11,581 documents to FAISS format
- **Benefit**: Better cloud platform compatibility and faster similarity search

### Python 3.13 Dependency Conflicts ✅  
- **Problem**: pandas==2.1.3 not compatible with Python 3.13.5 on Streamlit Cloud
- **Solution**: Removed pandas, sklearn, and other problematic dependencies
- **Result**: Streamlined requirements.txt with only essential dependencies

## Files Created/Updated:

✅ **requirements.txt** - Fixed Python 3.13 + SQLite3 compatibility (switched to FAISS)
✅ **.streamlit/secrets.toml** - Environment variables for cloud deployment  
✅ **.streamlit/config.toml** - Streamlit configuration
✅ **.gitignore** - Updated to include FAISS vector store for deployment
✅ **FAISS Vector store included** - 11,581 documents migrated from ChromaDB to FAISS format

## Next Steps:

### 1. Add Your API Key in Streamlit Cloud
When deploying, add your actual OpenRouter API key manually in the Streamlit Cloud secrets section:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
```

### 2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io
2. Click "New app"
3. Repository: `Akshay-i95/chatbot`
4. Branch: `main`
5. Main file: `app.py`
6. Copy contents of `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to secrets section

### 3. Git Commands
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 Ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment with vector store"
git push origin main
```

## Issue Fixed:
🐛 **SQLite3 Compatibility**: Resolved "Your system has an unsupported version of sqlite3. Chroma requires sqlite3 ≥ 3.35.0" error by migrating from ChromaDB to FAISS vector database.
